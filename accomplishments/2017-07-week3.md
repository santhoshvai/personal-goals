# This Weeks Accomplishments: 15 to 28-July-2017

## This Week's Focus: Resume the Evlo app

## Things I Did From the List:

- use AWS lambda to convert the evlo xml to protobuf-lite and store it in s3
	- Partial work: generated protobuf models and tested it to be much faster.

## Things I Didn't Get to/Finish:

- AWS lambda work to be done after. Now should focus on making protobuf integrate to the app.
- start waking up early, try to wake up daily at 6 AM

### Additional Things I Did:

- Started with React Native. Noob mode now.
- 4 days of fun time with relatives and did no work üòÅ.
